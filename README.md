## üöÄ Introduction
<p>This project is a standalone Python application that integrates with the Gmail API using OAuth for authentication. It fetches emails from your Gmail inbox and stores them in a local SQLite database. The application also allows you to process these emails based on a set of dynamic, rule-based operations defined in a JSON file. A graphical user interface (GUI) is provided using CustomTkinter for easy interaction, and a comprehensive test suite is included for ensuring the functionality of the system.</p>

## üî• Features
- ‚úÖ Gmail API Integration:Authenticate to Gmail using OAuth (credentials obtained from GCP)
- ‚úÖ Email Fetching:Retrieve a list of emails from your Gmail inbox and store them in an SQLite database.
- ‚úÖ Rule-Based Email Processing:Define dynamic rules (conditions and actions) stored in a JSON file. Supported    actions include marking emails as read/unread and moving emails to specified labels.
- ‚úÖ Testing:A set of unit and integration tests (in test.py) validate core functionalities.
- ‚úÖGraphical User Interface (GUI):A modern GUI built with CustomTkinter allows users to configure credentials, set fetching parameters, add rules, and apply them directly.
